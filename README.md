# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-Models-and-Django-Framework

## Description how I do
        
          •	I am going to provide a Machine Learning based solution to predict Diabetes of the
          patient in real time on the bases of different attributes e.g. blood pressure, glucose,
          BMI, age and so on.
          •	First of all, I need the training and testing dataset of diabetes patients, and I am
          using kaggle website to download the data set.
          •	This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive an
          Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not
          a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
          •	The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable,
          Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their
          BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
          •	I am going to apply 6 to 8 ML model to check accuracy in results and then select the
          best model in this aspect.
