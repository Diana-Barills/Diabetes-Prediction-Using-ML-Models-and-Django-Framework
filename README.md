# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML-Models-and-Django-Framework

## Description how I do
        
          •	I am going to provide a Machine Learning based solution to predict Diabetes of the
          patient in real time on the bases of different attributes e.g. blood pressure, glucose,
          BMI, age and so on.
          •	First of all, I need the training and testing dataset of diabetes patients, and I am
          using kaggle website to download the data set.
          •	This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive an
          Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not
          a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
          •	The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable,
          Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their
          BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
          •	I am going to apply 6 to 8 ML model to check accuracy in results and then select the
          best model in this aspect.
 
 ### Following ML models are going to be implemented:Basics Setting
	•	First of all, create a new project in pycharm, and run command (Django-admin startproject DiabetesPrediction). You can see some default files and folder, like manage.py, etc.
	•	The next step is to start our server, for that we have to type command in terminal ()
	•	In order to run whole project and run server type following commands (1. Python manage.py runserver)
	•	There is a link shown which is link of local host where our website resides.
	•	Create folder name templates under main directory (DiabetesPrediction). This is because we want to change the main html page of our site.
	•	Now create html file named as home inside template dir, and this home.html file is going to linked with main webage. 
	•	Now you can change the title to Home and in body you can write welcome to the home page. 
	•	The next step is to link this home.html in the urls.
	•	Open urls.py
                
          •	Linear Regression
          •	Logistic Regression
          •	SVM (Support Vector Machine) Algo
          •	Decision Tree Algo
          •	Random Forest Algo
          •	Naïve Bayes Algo
        
 ### Django
          
          •	For front end development, I will use Django framework to build Website. 
          •	Django is basically a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid
          development of secure and maintainable websites.
          •	Following are the examples of big websites, which use the Django framework
                •	YouTube
                •	Instagram
                •	Spotify
                •	Dropbox, etc.
